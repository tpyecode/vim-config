# Welcome to my Vim configuration
### One must be honest here. I did use CoPilot Ai to get this as since I don't know Vim Script that well but for now I like it.
### It is useful for my Fedora Linux Computer and my Fedora Linux WSL.
### If you see the commit history you will see I had 2 spaces for Java managed to get away with 4 spaces which is very good finally I can read code.

### I mainly use C for this text editor and before you ask no I am not a rust man never used it and don't plan to.
### Hope you like it! Feel free to fork this repo or tell me some good plugins for my work and please give me some feedback!
