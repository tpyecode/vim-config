# Welcome to my Vim configuration
### One must be honest here. I did use CoPilot Ai to get this as since I don't know Vim Script that well but for now I like it.
### It is useful for my Fedora Linux Computer and my Fedora Linux WSL.
### BTW I am not a fool the reason it is 2 spaces for Java files is primarily to do with Coding Standards at my Univeristy and one doesn't want to get penalised for having 4 spaces which I feel is dumb but oh well can't change everything can we.

### Also I am not a rust man I will remove the rust stuff in due course I wanted to see what the hype was about and didn't really see why everyone thinks it solves all their problems with memory saftey. I also hate how you don't assign datatypes in rust you instead bind names to a value which I hate the most so I will stick to C thank you very much


### Hope you like it! Feel free to fork this repo or tell me some good plugins for my work and please give me some feedback!
